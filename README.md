# Habit-Tracker 

This app tracks daily helps tracks my daily habits and journal entries on a calendar to show my daily habits throughout the month. 

## Motivation

I got this idea from the fact that I wanted to improve my morning routine by adding a few habits that would keep me focused throughout the day Instead of trying to remember if I've been keeping up with them, I wanted to display them on a calendar. This allowed me to get a visual perspective on how much progress I was making to keep these habits consistent.
